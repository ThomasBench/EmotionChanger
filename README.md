Image enhancement is a well-researched field with many papers written on this topic. In this project, we investigate and create an emotion-based image enhancement system by using pre-defined methods and algorithms. This system edits the images to increase the intensity of a given emotion to produce plausible images. 
Using scrapped images from Instagram, we created a dataset of 100 pictures for each emotion targeted: Those emotions were happy, sad, calm and fear. Then after extracting and applying the characteristics of these images (contrast,luminance,color palette, colorfulness) onto the targeted picture, we were able to enhance the emotion in the final image.

The code is entierly written on Python, and is available to  use on a jupyter notebook. A website will be developped to be able to enhance the images of anyone who wants to try the project.
